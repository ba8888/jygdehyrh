  <h1>Lil baby Music</h1>
  <p>
    At age seventeen, Lil Baby was a regular presence in the studio of
    Atlanta-based Quality Control Records as a drug dealer, until label founder
    Kevin "Coach K" Lee encouraged him to become a rapper, as he felt Baby had
    "the swag... the lingo, [and] respect around the city".[7] Fellow rappers
    Young Thug and Gunna served as Baby's mentors in developing his
    style.[9][10] He eventually released his first mixtape, Perfect Timing, in
    April 2017 with appearances from Young Thug and Lil Yachty. Another mixtape,
    Harder Than Hard, followed three months later; and in October released his
    third mixtape in six months, 2 The Hard Way, a collaboration with friend and
    fellow Atlanta rapper Marlo. A fourth mixtape, Too Hard, was released in
    December, led by his hit single "Freestyle" and accompanying music video. It
    was certified gold by the RIAA in February 2020. With his career gaining
    momentum, Baby released his debut studio album, Harder Than Ever, in May
    2018. It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200.[11] The album was
    supported by the singles "Southside" and "Yes Indeed" (with Drake), the
    latter peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. "Life Goes On"
    featuring Lil Uzi Vert and Gunna charted at 74 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1
